# SmartBall
This is the arduino code for my project of creating an IOT Ball! 
The Goal was to get real time data on the movement of a ball, 
Some of the code was changed to protect my credentials including passwords, emails, and wifi credentials.
So all that needs to be added is a connection to wifi, and a new connection to a database
to have it function properly!
